### 2 of the learning assistants were helping me with this problem and we have tried different solutions but neither of them can solve it.One of the LA even provided me with his solution code, I copy pasted his solution code into a new file and run it on my end, the same type error still shows up in my console, but not on his side.


### I tried running each deliverable seperately, the charts showed up no problem at all and no error was returned.


### The learning assistant suggested me to submit my work first and maybe the TAs could help me solve the problem.
